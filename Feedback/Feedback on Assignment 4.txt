Well done on Q1 Q2 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8

----------------------
Good work on Q3 Q4. However, because you used range(1, num), your code adds up all the numbers up to but not 
including the last number entered. Remember that in Python, the range() function stops before the second value. 
To include the final number, you should use range(1, num+1).
