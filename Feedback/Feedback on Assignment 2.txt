Well done, you have shown a clear understanding of the topic. However, in Q9, using three separate if statements is 
considered bad practice. While your code works, the computer still checks all of the if conditions even after one has 
already been satisfied. By using elif instead, once a condition is true, the rest will be skipped. For example, if the 
user enters 50, the first condition is met, and with elif, the program will not waste time checking the other conditions.
